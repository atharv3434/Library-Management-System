# Library-Management-System

A Library Management System (LMS) is software designed to manage the routine operations of a library. It helps librarians, students, and faculty by providing efficient methods for cataloging, borrowing, returning, and managing books or other library resources. Below is a detailed description of the project:

Project Objective
To develop a web-based or desktop application that streamlines the management of library resources. The system will enable users to search for books, borrow or return them, and keep track of borrowing histories while reducing manual efforts and errors.

This project is ideal for showcasing skills in full-stack development, database management, and problem-solving while providing a meaningful solution for educational institutions or public libraries.
